 * The key observation for this solution is that the possible rolls of the Dirac dice are always the same. Every
 * first roll is going to result in either 1, 2, or 3. For each of those outcomes, we have three more rolls like that,
 * and for each of those, we have another three. In total, there are 3^3 = 27 possible outcomes, which can be
 * summarized by this table:
 *

 *
 * Notice that all values are in range [3-9]. What's even more important is that these values repeat! For example,
 * the roll 6 appears 7 times in total. This means that there are 7 parallel universes where, at this very turn, the
 * current player has rolled a 6. The outcome for each of those universes must be the same, therefore we only have to
 * calculate the number of victories once, and simply multiply it by 7. The same logic applies to other rolls.
